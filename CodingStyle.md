To ensure the quality and maintainability of code we have decided on a style guide. 


For Dart: 

- Classes, enum types, typedefs, and type parameters should capitalize the first letter of each word (including the first word), and use no separators.
- name extensions use UpperCamelCase.
- libraries, packages, directories, and source files should be lowercase_with_underscores.
- name import prefixes must use lowercase_with_underscores.
- use lowerCamelCase for constant names.
- Use capitalized acronyms if it can be hard to read, and multiple adjacent acronyms can lead to ambiguous names.
- DON’T use prefix letters.
- place “dart:” imports before other imports.
- place “package:” imports before relative imports.
- specify exports in a separate section after all imports.
- sort sections alphabetically.
- Use Tabs for Intendation.
- Use Trailing Commas when possible. 
- Avoid lines longer than 80 characters.
- use curly braces for all flow control statements.
- Write comments simmilar to Javadoc for every Function/Class.
